Admin FAQ – DigiCert Quiz Hardening

Quick Links
- Rules v1 (first‑score‑only): docs/firebase-rules.v1.json
- Rules v2 (name/fingerprint enforcement): docs/firebase-rules.v2.json
- Plan and guidance: docs/hardening.md
 - Observe‑only machine prints: written under `machinePrints/{quizId}/{fpMachine}` (no enforcement in v2)

Quiz IDs
- Each quiz has an ID like `week-1-key-sovereignty`.
- Paths use this ID under `leaderboard/{quizId}/…`, `nameIndex/{quizId}/…`, `fingerprints/{quizId}/…`.

How to Apply Rules v1 (first‑score‑only)
1) Open Firebase Console → your project `digicert-product-quiz`.
2) Realtime Database → Rules.
3) Replace the contents with the JSON at docs/firebase-rules.v1.json and Publish.
4) Optional: adjust `score` max limit if needed (default 1000).

How to Upgrade to Rules v2 (enforce name + fingerprint)
1) Confirm most clients have shipped (app writes `nameSlug` + `fp`).
2) In Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Rules, paste docs/firebase-rules.v2.json and Publish.
3) Monitor write errors; if elevated, revert to v1 and investigate.

Optional: Observe‑Only Machine Prints
- The app writes `machinePrints/{quizId}/{fpMachine}` alongside `fingerprints`. Rules v2 allow these writes but do not enforce them on leaderboard validation.
- Use this to measure how many distinct uids share the same machine print before deciding to tighten further.

Enable v2.1 (Machine Prints Enforcement)
1) Confirm adoption: recent leaderboard entries include `fpMachine` and `machinePrints` keys for most users.
2) Check collisions: spot‑check `machinePrints/{quizId}` for duplicates mapping to different uids.
3) In Realtime Database → Rules, paste `docs/firebase-rules.v2.1.json` and Publish.
4) Test: first attempt (new device) saves; incognito or another browser on the same machine is blocked; duplicate name blocked.
5) Rollback: paste `docs/firebase-rules.v2.json` if you see unexpected “Permission denied” spikes.

Free a Device (fingerprint) to Allow a Replay (v2)
- Go to Realtime Database → Data.
- Navigate to `fingerprints/{quizId}` and locate the hashed key for the device (fp).
- Delete `fingerprints/{quizId}/{fp}` to release the device lock.

Change/Correct a Player’s Display Name (v2)
1) Find the player’s `uid` under `leaderboard/{quizId}` (key is the uid). Confirm by matching `name/score/timestamp`.
2) Compute the old/new slugs:
   - old: the value in `leaderboard/{quizId}/{uid}/nameSlug`
   - new: lowercased, punctuation‑stripped, spaces to hyphens (same as app)
3) Update both:
   - Set `leaderboard/{quizId}/{uid}/name` to the new display name
   - Set `leaderboard/{quizId}/{uid}/nameSlug` to the new slug
   - Delete `nameIndex/{quizId}/{oldSlug}`
   - Create `nameIndex/{quizId}/{newSlug}` with value `uid`

Allow a Player a Fresh Attempt (v1 or v2)
- v1 only (first‑score‑only): delete `leaderboard/{quizId}/{uid}`.
- v2: also delete the device fingerprint and (optionally) the name index if reusing the name:
  - `leaderboard/{quizId}/{uid}`
  - `fingerprints/{quizId}/{fp}` (value of `fp` is in the player’s leaderboard record)
  - `nameIndex/{quizId}/{nameSlug}` (if you need to free the name)
  - If you later enforce machine prints, also delete `machinePrints/{quizId}/{fpMachine}`

Investigate “Permission denied” Errors
- Second attempt from same browser: blocked by v1 (`!data.exists()`).
- Incognito/same device after v2: blocked by `fingerprints` mapping.
- Duplicate display name after v2: blocked by `nameIndex` mapping.

Adjust Score Cap in Rules
- In the rules’ `.validate`, change the upper bound (default `<= 1000`).
- Rough formula: `maxTime × numberOfQuestions`. For the current quiz: `100 × 5 = 500`.

Rollback
- To relax restrictions: paste docs/firebase-rules.v1.json into the Rules editor and publish.
- App remains compatible; it falls back to a single leaderboard write if index writes are denied.

Where to Find a Player’s UID
- Realtime Database → `leaderboard/{quizId}` → each child key is the player’s `uid`.
- You can match by `name` and `score` to identify the correct record.

Notes
- The device fingerprint stored is a salted SHA‑256 hash (no raw device data).
- Reads are public; writes require anonymous auth and pass rules checks.
